This code shows some resources spread in a terrain (as quantity of resources rises, the spot gets brighter).
Ants are shown as red tiny squares that moves around the terrain.
Their work is to pile those resources, so where there is less quantity, they pick up a resource unit, and they drop it where there is more of it.
